## Introduction

The **`mtcars`** dataset is a built-in dataset in R that provides information on various attributes of 32 car models, such as horsepower, weight, and fuel efficiency.

In this mini-report, we explore how *horsepower (hp)* affects *fuel efficiency (miles per gallon or mpg)* using a simple scatter plot.

## Plot: Horsepower vs Miles per Gallon

```{r}
# Load the dataset
data(mtcars)

# Create scatter plot
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
     main = "Fuel Efficiency vs Horsepower",
     xlab = "Horsepower (hp)",
     ylab = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
     col = "darkgreen",
     pch = 16)
```

## Interpretation

The scatter plot shows a **negative trend** â€” as *horsepower* increases, *miles per gallon* tends to decrease. This suggests that more powerful cars generally have lower fuel efficiency, which aligns with expectations.

This quick visualization highlights how graphical summaries can reveal real-world trade-offs in car performance.
